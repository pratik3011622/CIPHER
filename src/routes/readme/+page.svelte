                    Cipher Saga 3.0 is the third installment of the online cryptic hunt event hosted
                    during EPITOME, the annual techno-management fest of Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya.
                    Participants will team up to tackle a series of
                    challenging levels, deciphering clues and solving
                    riddles to progress. The event will test their wit,
                    collaboration, and problem-solving skills, which
                    will probably leave everyone thrilled and eager for
                    more.

                    A cryptic hunt is like a puzzle-solving game where
                    you solve riddles, clues, or challenges to move from
                    one hint to the next. Each clue usually leads to the
                    next clue, and the goal is to reach the final answer
                    of a level by decoding all the hints along the way.
                    It often involves thinking creatively, solving
                    wordplay, interpreting patterns, and sometimes even
                    searching online for hidden answers. It's a fun mix
                    of brain teasers, logic, and exploration. Cipher
                    coders, AI tools, QR codes, coding softwares, etc.
                    are all allowed and encouraged to be used.

                    Winners will be decided based on the leaderboard
                    standings at the end of the competition. The leaderboard ranks teams based on
                    how quickly they solve the puzzles, with teams that
                    solve earlier being placed higher. Accuracy is not a
                    criteria.

                        Lead confirmations are short private yes/no

                        are on in the dedicated private channels on
                        Discord and organizers would respond with yes or

                        default and this number is subject to change. Be
                        updated on Discord. Unused leads don't stack.

                    Cryptic hunts generally revolve around tech, trivia,
                    and mostly anything you can find on the internet.
                    Googling is allowed and heavily encouraged, but it
                    won't directly get you the answer in most cases.
                    Think logically, make connections between different
                    parts of levels. Cryptic hunts are all about
                    connecting the dots and finding the solutions.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify text-sm text-neutral-400 pb-1">
                    Keep getting your leads confirmed from the
                    organizers. If you think you've gotten stuck
                    somewhere, seek for hints on Discord. The levels
                    will basically consist of a set of clues, all which
                    link to ONE ANSWER. The difficulty is random. When
                    you get two or more clues, try to connect them and
                    find an interrelated clue from it. If you can't
                    figure out the hint, try breaking it down and
                    solving it in parts.

                        <strong>Hunt's Site:</strong> Clues are sometimes
                        hidden in the hunt's rules and maybe even in the
                        event descriptions. The page title. The URL. Focus
                        on every word carefully as almost every hunt uses
                        a lot of wordplay.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Source Code:</strong> Look at the code comments.
                        There could be other links inside the code (This
                        especially helps in cases in which there aren't any
                        on-screen clues). You can even try using Inspect
                        Element (Ctrl+Shift+I) or Viewing Page Source (Ctrl+Shift+U).

                        <strong>Audio Files:</strong> Inspect the name, duration,
                        and content. Use spectrograms and tools like Audacity
                        or Sonic Visualizer for hidden text. Look for morse
                        code, binary, or locked files. Adjust the tempo or
                        format for clues.

                        extract relevant audio, or slow down/speed up videos
                        to uncover clues. Visual or audio elements like morse/binary
                        code may be hidden.

                        <strong>Images:</strong> Check the image file name,
                        dimensions, and metadata for hidden strings or steganography.
                        Use tools like Aperisolve to detect and extract hidden
                        info by adjusting contrast or brightness.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Backlinks:</strong> If it looks like a completely
                        random string, try appending it to the end of common
                        URL patterns, like bit.ly/string, youtube.com/watch?v=string
                        etc. This is known as a backlink. Backlinks are key!
                        Use sites like imgur, pastebin, bit.ly, and tinyurl.
                        For encrypted pastebins, find the password clues.
                        Use a4x.me to identify backlinks when unsure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ciphers:</strong> Pay attention to ciphers,
                        such as Morse code, binary, or simple text substitutions
                        (like Caesar or Vigenère ciphers). The creators are
                        known to use a lot of ciphers, so expect clues to
                        be encoded in these forms, often hidden within clues
                        or images.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Geocodes:</strong> Sometimes, when there are random numbers on the screen, try using geocoding sites that can make you arrive at the next clue. Try puting those coordinates in Google maps or geocoding sites like geocode.xyz. Another site called geoapify.com can prove useful as well. Try lingering with the words and get to sites like what3words or any other popular and unique geocoding software.
